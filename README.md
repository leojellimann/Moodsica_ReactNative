# Moodsica_ReactNative

Moodsica is a social network mobile app I built and I am still upgrading it daily in React Native.
Indeed, I started working on this app as a personal project in 2020.
I built it to understand the differents languages and ways to build a mobile app from A to Z.
Indeed, building a mobile app became a purpose for my Computer Science future in order to work in this field later.

To build this app, I've been through many paths using Node.js and Expo Go every time.

First, I built it using JavaScript and Firebase for the backend.
Thanks to this experience, I acquired knowledge about how to link and save datas from a mobile app to a database.

After using it with my friends, I decided to go bigger and switch from JavaScript to TypeScript and from Firebase to AWS.
I then discovered a new way to save data thanks to DynamoDB and GraphQL.

But you may wonder what does this app do ?

I've always wanted to know which song my friends were listening to.
Why ? By listening always the same songs, I ran out of music to listen.
While you don't know what song to listen to, your friends around you listen musics that you've never heard of before.

This mobile app started out as an app made for people who want to discover new songs for their tracklist.
Little by little my idea on the subject grow bigger.
Now, the purpose is to revolutionize the way people discover and listen to music.

Thanks to Spotify API, Moodsica allows its users to share 30sec preview of the music they want to share on a feed.

As I may want to put it in production in the future, I can't share the code with you but here are screenshots of the app :

Here is the first sign in/sign up screen when you open the app :

Once the user is logged in, he arrives on the main feed :

Here, you can find musics preview from users of the app.
You can also see at the bottom the preview currently playing by the user.

A user can also create a new post :
These are the results of the Spotify API call to get the songs depending on what title/artist the user is looking for :
The list of preview songs refreshes each time the textinput changes.

Once a song is selected, here is the result of the new post screen :

Finally, once the user published his post, he and everyone can see his post and all his otherss on his profile :

I apologize for not sharing the code with you, but I hope you understand how much I enjoy building mobile app.
On the first hand, because I built a full mobile app in React Native as a personal project just by myself.
On the other hand, because I loved learning so many things thanks to the creation of this project as well as I loved to create a beautiful UI.

I hope you enjoyed reading that with a wonderful song in your ears :)
